# Overlapping Community Detection with Graph Neural Networks

This work aims to conduct the overlapping community detection for the trajectory data. 


## Usage
The main algorithm and other utilities are implemented in the `nocd` package that can be installed as
```bash
python setup.py install
```
A Jupyter notebook [interactive.ipynb](interactive.ipynb) contains the code for training the model and analyzing the results.



## Requirements
```
numpy=1.16.4
pytorch=1.2.0
scipy=1.3.1
```


```
